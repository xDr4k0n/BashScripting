=  compare if two strings are equal
!=  compare if two strings are not equal
-n  evaluate if string length is greater than zero
-z  evaluate if string length is equal to zero 

Examples: 
[ s1 = s2 ]  (true if s1 same as s2, else false)
[ s1 != s2 ]  (true if s1 not same as s2, else false)
[ s1 ]   (true if s1 is not empty, else false)
[ -n s1 ]   (true if s1 has a length greater then 0, else false)
[ -z s2 ]   (true if s2 has a length of 0, otherwise false)

Number Comparisons: 
------------------------------------
-eq compare if two numbers are equal
-ge compare if one number is greater than or equal to a number
-le  compare if one number is less than or equal to a number
-ne  compare if two numbers are not equal
-gt  compare if one number is greater than another number
-lt  compare if one number is less than another number 

Examples: 
[ n1 -eq n2 ]  (true if n1 same as n2, else false)
[ n1 -ge n2 ]  (true if n1greater then or equal to n2, else false)
[ n1 -le n2 ]  (true if n1 less then or equal to n2, else false)
[ n1 -ne n2 ]  (true if n1 is not same as n2, else false)
[ n1 -gt n2 ]  (true if n1 greater then n2, else false)
[ n1 -lt n2 ]  (true if n1 less then n2, else false)
